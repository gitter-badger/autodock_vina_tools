[Autodock Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/) is an open-source program for doing molecular docking. It was designed and implemented by Dr. Oleg Trott in the Molecular Graphics Lab at The Scripps Research Institute.
[MGL Tools](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/) is a software developed at the Molecular Graphics Laboratory (MGL) of The Scripps Research Institute for visualization and analysis of molecular structures.
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. Whether on the [free public server](http://usegalaxy.org/) or [your own instance](http://getgalaxy.org/), you can perform, reproduce, and share complete analyses.

## Galaxy tools for docking protein-ligands

This project implements an interface for some scripts of MGL Tools and the Autodock Vina program in Galaxy platform. This tools enable perform virtual screening on Galaxy platform.
